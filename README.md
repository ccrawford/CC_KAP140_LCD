> [!NOTE]  
> This repository contains the MobiFlight custom device code and the hardware construction files for my implementation of a KAP140
autopilot using a RP2040 and a 3.12" OLED screen. The MobiFlight profile is for the WBSim C172 which has a more complete implmentation of the KAP140. You can use it with the Asobo KAP140, but will require some mods to the MobiFlight mcc file.


## Prerequisites
** Requires use of a custom MobiFlight board and device (included here) to get the screen to function.
* 3d printer. I use a very old FlashForge Creator Pro 2, so any decent 3d printer will suffice.
* Laser cutter/etcher. I use my local library's Epilog Fusion 60. Alternately, you could cut the PCB with a dremel and paint/hand letter.
* Various hardware and supplies listed [here](https://github.com/ccrawford/CC_KAP140_LCD/blob/main/Hardware/Instructions.md)
